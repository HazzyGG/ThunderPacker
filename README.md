# ThunderPacker
Packs mods for Thunderstore, the mod hosting site. This program automatically creates a manifest.json file, which you can edit within the program. 
This program automatically creates a README.md file which you can edit within the program. 
This program moves your mod to your set folder, so you dont need to do it yourself. 
Packaging thunderstore mods can be a long process, but ThunderPacker makes it easier
